"""Guard against drift between skills/slc-device-ops/SKILL.md and server.py.

Two checks:
1. Every tool-shaped name the skill mentions exists, either as a registered tool
   here or as a documented companion tool on percepxion-mcp-server.
2. Every registered tool is mentioned in the skill at least once, so new tools
   don't ship undocumented.

Tool names in both repos are verb-first by convention, which is what lets a
regex separate tool mentions from parameter names.
